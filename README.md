# resume-automation

## About:

This project is an attempt to automate the organization of all the resumes that I tailor for a job application. Rather then manually create a new folder and copy and paste the relevant documents, I want to be able to drag and drop a resume that follows a simple naming convention into a folder that will automatically create a new folder for that resume and cover letter
